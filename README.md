# Multi-container Orchestration with Docker Compose

### In this project I have successfully dockerized three separate applications for development purposes only, using the docker-compose.yaml file.  It includes a database, a node backend app and a react frontend app, dockerized within there own containers but can communicate with each other and persist data across container removal.
### When loaded, the React frontend UI is launched automatically and takes incoming request for users to submit, view and delete goals.  Each submitted goal get stored in the MongoDB database. Each goal can be deleted by clicking on each goal.
