# Multi-container Orchestration with Docker Compose

### In this project I have successfully dockerized three separate application using the docker-compose.yaml file.  It includes a database, a node backend app and a react frontend app, dockerized within there own containers.
### When loaded the React frontend UI is launched, this allows you to submit goals which then get stored in the MongoDB database and can be deleted by clicking on each goal.
